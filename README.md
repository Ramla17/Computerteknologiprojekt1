Welcome to the repository for our self-driving Turtlebot 3! 

Here, you'll discover a collection of programs designed to facilitate various functionalities of our robot. Among them are smaller programs like "ReadFromLightSensor," dedicated to specific sensor readings, and our main program, named "turtlebot3_obstacle," which orchestrates the robot's obstacle avoidance and navigation tasks. Dive in to explore our codebase and witness the intricate workings of our autonomous Turtlebot 3 system.
